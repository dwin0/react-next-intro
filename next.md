## Problem with Client Side Rendering

Browser has to wait for all resources to be downloaded and executed, before the content is visible (HTML, CSS, JS) -> Bad user experience and bad SEO score

## Solution: Rendering on Server

* HTML is generated on the Server with all necessary data (not just empty root element)
* Statically or dynamically (Next.js supports both)
